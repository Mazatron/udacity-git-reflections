When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working on different computers or with a team of people that all need
  access to the same commits.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So you don't automatically publish changes that are not yet ready for
  publication.
