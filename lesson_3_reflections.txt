When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

  When working on different computers or with a team of people that all need
  access to the same commits.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  So you don't automatically publish changes that are not yet ready for
  publication.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  Branches are used when you want to make two versions of the same commit that
  can be merged back together at some point in the future.

  Cloning is used to duplicate an entire repository including its commit
  history.

  Forks are used when you modify code from a public source where you have
  permission to use and modify the existing code for yourself but don't have
  permission to change the public version. The commits after a fork are not
  intended to be merged in the future.
