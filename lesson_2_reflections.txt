What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  An empty Git repository is initialised.

  It is needed to enable the storage of the meta data related to file changes
  that are later commited to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area enables the user to discard a change made to a file that has
  already been saved in the working directory but is not supposed to be commited
  to the repository (eg. due to an error).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  If several files are changed while working on the same logical change, one
  file can be changed and staged after another. Once all files have been
  changed, they can all be commited at the same time.

  The staging area can also be used to compare the most recent commit with the
  changes in the staging area to check if it is really only one logical change
  that is about to be commited. If there are more changes the files can be
  removed from the staging area without being deleted before being added to the
  repository in a later commit.
